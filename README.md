AI Job Recommendation System is a semantic, NLP-powered web application built using Streamlit that intelligently matches user profiles with relevant job roles.
Instead of relying on simple keyword matching, the system understands the meaning of skills and experience using Sentence Transformers, enabling more accurate and context-aware job recommendations.

Users can upload their resume in PDF format or manually enter skills. The application extracts and cleans the input data, converts it into embeddings, and compares it against a curated job dataset using cosine similarity. The top-matched job roles are ranked and displayed with direct application links to LinkedIn and Naukri, making the job search process faster and smarter.

This project demonstrates the practical use of Natural Language Processing, semantic search, and machine learning models in building real-world, AI-driven applications.
